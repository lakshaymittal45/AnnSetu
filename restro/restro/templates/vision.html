            <h2>💡 Our Vision</h2>
            <p>We envision an India where no meal is wasted, and no person goes hungry. Our tech-driven solution aims to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce food waste at source – enabling food businesses to donate rather than discard.</li>
                <li>Strengthen the NGO ecosystem by providing them with a consistent, scalable food supply.</li>
                <li>Create a self-sustaining cycle where surplus food benefits both donors and recipients.</li>
                <li>Lower India’s carbon footprint by minimizing methane emissions from decomposing food waste.</li>
                <li>Encourage community participation in food rescue efforts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>AnnSetu is not just an app—it’s a movement for responsible consumption, sustainability, and social equity.</p>

        <!-- Problem Section -->
        <div class="article">
            <h2>📉 The Problem: The Cost of Wasting Food in India</h2>
            <p>India wastes 68 million tons of food annually, while 40 crore people struggle with food insecurity.</p>
            <p>₹92,000 crores worth of food is discarded every year—this could feed 100 million people.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>25% of India's freshwater is used to grow food that is never eaten.</li>
                <li>300 million barrels of oil go into producing wasted food.</li>
                <li>Landfills filled with food waste generate 3.3 billion tons of CO₂ annually, accelerating climate change.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Many restaurants and event organizers discard surplus food due to a lack of reliable redistribution channels.</p>
            <p>Religious and cultural events also generate thousands of uneaten meals daily, with no structured mechanism to distribute them.</p>
